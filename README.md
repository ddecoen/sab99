# SAB 99: Materiality and the Auditor's Consideration of Misstatements

## Overview

SAB 99 (Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99) is a crucial guidance issued by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance and Office of the Chief Accountant in August 1999. It provides comprehensive guidance on how auditors and management should evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements, particularly addressing the exclusive reliance on quantitative thresholds.

## Key Principles

### 1. Materiality Assessment
- **Quantitative vs. Qualitative**: SAB 99 emphasizes that materiality determinations cannot be based solely on quantitative benchmarks (such as the "5% rule")
- **Holistic Approach**: Both quantitative and qualitative factors must be considered when evaluating misstatements
- **Context Matters**: The significance of a misstatement depends on the particular facts and circumstances

### 2. Qualitative Factors to Consider

SAB 99 identifies several qualitative factors that may cause quantitatively small misstatements to be material:

- **Earnings Management**: Whether the misstatement masks a change in earnings or other trends
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Impact on compliance with loan covenants, regulatory requirements, or other contractual obligations
- **Analyst Expectations**: Whether the misstatement changes a loss into income or vice versa, or enables meeting analyst consensus expectations
- **Market Perception**: Effect on stock price or market perception of the company
- **Management Intent**: Whether the misstatement appears to be intentional to achieve desired results
- **Segment Performance**: Impact on the significance of a particular business segment or geographic area
- **Future Period Impact**: Potential effect on future financial statements

## Out-of-Period Adjustments

### Definition and Context
Out-of-period adjustments occur when companies record corrections of errors or misstatements that relate to prior accounting periods in the current period's financial statements, rather than restating the prior period statements.

### SAB 99 Guidance on Out-of-Period Adjustments

#### When Out-of-Period Adjustments May Be Appropriate
- The misstatement is **not material** to the prior period financial statements
- The adjustment is **not material** to the current period financial statements
- Both quantitative and qualitative factors support immateriality

#### Key Considerations

1. **Dual Materiality Test**:
   - Assess materiality relative to the prior period (when the error occurred)
   - Assess materiality relative to the current period (when the correction is made)
   - Both tests must conclude immateriality for out-of-period treatment

2. **"Iron Curtain" vs. "Rollover" Methods**:
   - **Iron Curtain Method**: Evaluates materiality based on the amount of error in the balance sheet at the end of the current period
   - **Rollover Method**: Evaluates materiality based on the amount of error flowing through the current period's income statement
   - SAB 99 requires consideration of both methods

3. **Accumulation of Misstatements**:
   - Individual immaterial items may become material in aggregate
   - Must consider the "carryover" effect of prior period misstatements
   - Trend analysis and pattern recognition are crucial

### Documentation Requirements

When making out-of-period adjustments, companies should document:
- Nature and amount of the misstatement
- Periods affected and discovery date
- Quantitative materiality analysis for both periods
- Qualitative factors considered
- Conclusion supporting immateriality determination
- Management's rationale for out-of-period treatment

## Practical Implementation

### For Management
1. **Establish Clear Policies**: Develop written policies for evaluating misstatements
2. **Regular Assessment**: Continuously monitor and assess accumulated misstatements
3. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of materiality judgments
4. **Consultation**: Engage with auditors early when material items are identified

### For Auditors
1. **Professional Skepticism**: Apply appropriate professional skepticism to management's materiality judgments
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for patterns or trends in misstatements
4. **Clear Communication**: Communicate findings clearly to the audit committee and management

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-reliance on quantitative thresholds** (e.g., assuming anything under 5% is automatically immaterial)
- **Ignoring qualitative factors** that may make small amounts material
- **Inadequate documentation** of materiality judgments
- **Failure to consider accumulation** of individually immaterial items
- **Inappropriate use of out-of-period adjustments** to avoid restatements

## Regulatory Context

### SEC Enforcement
The SEC has consistently enforced SAB 99 principles, particularly:
- Cases involving intentional misstatements to meet earnings targets
- Situations where quantitatively small misstatements had significant qualitative implications
- Improper accumulation of "immaterial" adjustments over multiple periods

### Related Guidance
- **SAB 108**: Provides additional guidance on correcting errors in previously issued financial statements
- **ASC 250**: Accounting Standards Codification guidance on accounting changes and error corrections
- **AU-C 320**: Auditing standards on materiality in planning and performing an audit

## Conclusion

SAB 99 fundamentally changed how materiality is assessed in financial reporting by requiring a more nuanced, comprehensive approach that considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. For out-of-period adjustments specifically, it established the important principle that corrections must be evaluated for materiality in both the period of origin and the period of correction.

The guidance emphasizes that professional judgment, rather than mechanical application of numerical thresholds, should drive materiality determinations. This approach better serves investors and other financial statement users by ensuring that all material information is appropriately presented and disclosed.
